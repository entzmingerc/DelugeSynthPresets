# Deluge Community Synth Presets

This is a collection of synth presets for the Synthstrom Deluge posted on the internet by other Deluge players. A list of other free non-distributable synth packs and paid for synth presets is below. 

If you would like to contribute to this repository, feel free to submit a PR with your artist name and the XML files of the synth preset. No samples are used in these presets. If you want to upload presets that require samples or wavetables, please add a link to the location to download the files. (Optional) Create a document in the DOCS forlder for any descriptions and links you'd like to provide.  

This collection is sourced from presets found on the Synthstrom Audible Forum, Deluge Community Discord Group, and patchstorage.com. Presets that seemed redistributable were collected. Preset packs that were not for redistribution or cost money are linked below. If you would like to remove your name and/or content from this list, please let me know or submit a PR.
