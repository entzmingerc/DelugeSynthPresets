B Random - 15 synths not touched by human hand

These synths were randomly created as a demonstration of Delugeator 2.0's random synth generator for FW 4+. 
They were not edited afterwards and are not intented to be really useful or stuff like that but I thought they sounded funny. 

Listen, use and edit at your own risk, no earsplitters included (well, maybe Brainwrecker). Remember to have fun.

Installation: unzip to SYNTHS-folder in your Deluge SD card.

Oh and these are in a folder, if you haven't used Deluge synth folders before it's LOAD + SYNTH and you see folders, see this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amgilVS-C1k
